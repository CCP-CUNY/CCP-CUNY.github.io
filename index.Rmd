# **Cognitive and Comparative Psychology ( CCP @ CUNY )**

### Mission Statement

Students and faculty in the CCP training area conduct research to understand the functions and mechanisms of cognition, communication, and behavior in human and non-human animals. We work on perception, memory, attention, creativity, concepts, learning, decision-making, language acquisition and processing, and communication across species. We take an integrative approach that combines cognitive, evolutionary, ecological, and comparative frameworks to answer fundamental questions about the bases of cognition, communication, and behavior. We use a variety of methods â€“ observations, experiments in the field and the laboratory, neuroscience, and computational modelling. We prepare students for careers in academia (research and teaching), as well as in health, education, business, and industrial settings.
